# introToDataScience

This repository is the basic Introduction to Data Science in Python. I feel it will be great help for those starting with Data Science.

Data scientist need to have these skills:

1. Basic Tools: Like python, R or SQL. You do not need to know everything. What you only need is to learn how to use python
2. Basic Statistics: Like mean, median or standart deviation. If you know basic statistics, you can use python easily.
3. Data Munging: Working with messy and difficult data. Like a inconsistent date and string formatting. As you guess, python helps us.
4. Data Visualization: Title is actually explanatory. We will visualize the data with python like matplot and seaborn libraries.
5. Machine Learning: You do not need to understand math behind the machine learning technique. You only need is understanding basics of machine learning and learning how to implement it while using python.

----

All the codes are written in [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) (Python [2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

After installing Jupyter Notebook, run it through terminal:

```
jupyter notebook
```

##### To install mentioned libraries:

###### Numpy:

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. 

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip  
sudo pip install numpy scipy
```

###### Pandas:

Easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

```
sudo pip install pandas
```

Similarly Install [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html), etc.
